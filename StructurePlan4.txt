Hi Camille!

1. Create commands in TestSim.py for hello, msg, whisper, and listusr.
2. Change logic in msgBuff to store chars


s.hello(4, 'camille', 15);
s.hello(8, 'adrian', 5);
s.msg(4, 'Hello World');
s.whisper(4, 'adrian', 'Hello World'); # send message from 4 to "adrian"
s.listusr(4);

Design Choices:
Do I make a separate command for
all cases?
Or do I use the same command for all of
them?
More code, server is gonna have to interpret anyway.
Going with separate option.

final choice:
hello will be a separate command.
everything else is same.
only making hello for now.
-- no, each has diff # of arguments
option - set other arguments to 0?

choice: just do hello for now with 
temp names.

goal: finish hello() and msg();


read() {
    1. check for /r/n.
        a. if we got it, then take the string from lastRead to curr
        if not, return
}


officially giving up and moving on!
will make a NEW hashmap of usernames instead
of messing with this dumb socket stuff >:(

1. Node has an array of sockets
    a. A socket is a random number (identifier) and a socket data structure
    b. Sockets are connections, not headers. A new socket is made for every destination.


Sockets:
    1. On cmdTestServer, open a socket to listen for connections (passive open)
        a. socket()
        b. bind()
        c. listen()
    2. On cmdTestClient, open a socket and attempt to make a connection (active open)
        a. socket()
        b. connection()
    3. If a node is trying to connect with you, accept the connection
        a. accept()

Three-Way Handshake
    1. Goal: Agree on two numbers
        a. Starting Sequence Numbers
        b. Next byte expected
    2. Send a SYN pack to start connection with random sequence number (x)
    3. When recieved, send a SYN+ACK with my own random sequence number (y) and ACK = x + 1
    4. When SYN+ACK is recieved, send ACK back w sequence number = x + 1 and ACK = y + 1
